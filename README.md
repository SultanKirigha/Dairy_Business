### Description
>I just landed myself a great deal and acquired a farm upcountry that has dairy cattle.<br>
>These cows are well fed and they produce a fair amount of milk every day.<br>
> Luckily, Brookside Dairies has also called you in, for yet another deal to sell your milk produce to them for processing.<br>
> There's one problem though, you're very engaged in a website consultation company which leaves very little time for you to monitor milk production at your farm.<br>
> Your cows will make you rich if you monitor their milk production and sale.<br>
> The site I have built using HTML,CSS and Javascript.<br>
> That helps you monitor production and sales.
