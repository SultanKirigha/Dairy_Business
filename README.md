### Description
> I just landed yourself a great deal and acquired a farm upcountry that has dairy cattle.
> These cows are well fed and they produce a fair amount of milk every day. 
> Luckily, Brookside Dairies has also called you in, for yet another deal to sell your milk produce to them for processing.
> There's one problem though, you're very engaged in a website consultation company which leaves very little time for you to monitor milk production at your farm.
> Your cows will make you rich if you monitor their milk production and sale.
> The site I have built using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
> That helps you monitor production and sales.
